Estimating the m probabilities of the model by blocking on:
(l."first_name" = r."first_name") AND (l."middle_initial" = r."middle_initial") AND (l."last_name" = r."last_name")

Parameter estimates will be made for the following comparison(s):

    - street_name
    - sex

Parameter estimates cannot be made for the following comparison(s) since they are used in the blocking rules: 
    - first_name
